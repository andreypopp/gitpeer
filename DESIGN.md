# GitPeer design document

## Architecture overview

GitPeer designed as a set of reusable modules and application templates.

## Auth

We need to do federated authentication between different GitPeer installations.

User should be able to sign in using her GitHub account.

Every GitPeer installation could choose different access level for different
groups of users.
